      "Sale (hereinafter referred to as the “Agreement”) with the respondents \n",
      "on 22.11.1990 to sell the suit property for a consideration of \n",
      "Rs.21,000/-, against which Rs.3000/- had been received in advance. \n",
      "Further, six months’ time was fixed for completion of the transaction. \n",
      "The appellants No.1, 2 & 3, in the meantime, had executed a Sale \n",
      "Deed with regard to the property in question with appellant no.7 on \n",
      "05.11.1997 for a consideration of Rs.22,000/-. On 18.11.1997, the [2024] 1 S.C.R.  377\n",
      "Alagammal and Ors. v. Ganesan and Anr.\n",
      "respondents sent a Notice to the appellants calling upon them to \n",
      "execute the Agreement. This led to the respondents filing of Original \n",
      "Suit No.165 of 1998 before the Munsif, District Court, Dindigul \n",
      "against the appellants for specific performance of the Agreement, \n",
      "damages and for recovery of money with interest. The suit stood \n",
      "dismissed by the Principal District Munsif Judge , Dindigul by order \n",
      "dated 10.09.2000. An appeal bearing A.S. No.258 of 2008 filed by \n",
      "the respondents was allowed by the First Appellate Court, and the \n",
      "same has been upheld by the High Court by the Impugned Judgment \n",
      "dated 28.04.2009.\n",
      "SUBMISSIONS BY THE APPELLANTS:\n",
      "4. Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that as per the \n",
      "Agreement, the balance consideration amount of Rs. 18,000/- was \n",
      "to be paid within six months which was admittedly not done. He \n",
      "submitted that the so-called subsequent payments on 16.12.1990 \n",
      "of Rs.1,000/-; on 15.04.1991 of Rs.3,000/-, and; on 17.09.1991 of \n",
      "Rs.2,500/- though were not actually paid to the appellants and even \n",
      "without admitting the same and accepting it for the sake of argument, \n",
      "the same is incorrect as the fingerprint expert has found the thumb-\n",
      "impression of the appellant no.1 as not matching the admitted actual \n",
      "sample thumb-impression of the appellant no.1. and, thus, the very \n",
      "basis of holding that time was not the essence of the agreement \n",
      "gets washed away. It was submitted that the Agreement stipulated \n",
      "that if there was default on the part of the respondents, the advance \n",
      "paid would be forfeited, and the entitlement to obtain the Sale Deed \n",
      "and get possession free from all encumbrances would also end. \n",
      "5. It was submitted that once the fingerprint has been disapproved of by \n",
      "an expert and such report has been brought before the First Appellate \n",
      "Court, the claim based on such a document on which forgery has \n",
      "been committed itself renders the whole transaction inadmissible in \n",
      "law on the well-settled principle that the respondents did not come \n",
      "before the Court with clean hands as the entire claim was based \n",
      "on a forged document.\n",
      "6. It was submitted that the claim of the respondents to have paid \n",
      "Rs.3,000/- on 18.09.1992; Rs.1,800/- on 24.07.1996; Rs.1,300/- on \n",
      "25.07.1996 and Rs.1,000/- on 29.07.1996 i.e., a total of Rs.20,425/- 378 [2024] 1 S.C.R.\n",
      "Digital Supreme Court Reports\n",
      "and ultimately Rs.1,000/- on 21.04.1997 i.e., an excess of Rs. 425/- \n",
      "over the amount indicated in the Agreement, was false.\n",
      "7. Learned counsel submitted that the endorsement(s) made not having \n",
      "been proved, it cannot be assumed that the respondents were ready \n",
      "and willing, or that they had, in fact, paid the excess amount.\n",
      "8. It was contended that the Legal Notice sent on behalf of the \n",
      "respondents dated 18.11.1997 was clearly to get over the fatal \n",
      "lapses on their part and to give life to a dead cause i.e., revive the \n",
      "Agreement, which already stood incapable of being executed through \n",
      "Court due to efflux of time. On this issue, the contention was that \n",
      "readiness and willingness must be pleaded and proved which has not \n",
      "been done as is clear from the averments made in the plaint filed by \n",
      "the respondents. Thus, it was submitted that the trial court and even \n",
      "the First Appellate Court not recording any finding on the aspect of \n",
      "the readiness and willingness on the part of the respondents, the \n",
      "High Court’s observation in the Impugned Judgement on readiness \n",
      "and willingness of the respondents is without basis.\n",
      "9. Learned counsel submitted that readiness and willingness has to be \n",
      "specifically pleaded and proved as per Section 16(c) of the Specific \n",
      "Relief Act, 1963 (hereinafter referred to as the “1963 Act”) and there \n",
      "cannot be any question of drawing inference. Thus, he submitted that \n",
      "the respondents were obliged to obtain stamp-paper and draw up the \n",
      "Sale Deed, of which there is no indication in the plaint. It was urged \n",
      "that this establishes that there was no readiness and willingness to \n",
      "comply with their obligations in terms of the Agreement.\n",
      "10. Learned counsel submitted that the thumb-impression(s) in the \n",
      "endorsement(s) have neither matched nor been found to be identical \n",
      "as per the fingerprint expert’s report which has been referred to in \n",
      "the judgment of the First Appellate Court.\n",
      "11. Learned counsel submitted that as per the judgment rendered by \n",
      "the First Appellate Court and affirmed by the High Court, the last \n",
      "payment made and endorsed on 17.09.1991 has been accepted and \n",
      "thus three years from such date would be 16.09.1994 but the suit was \n",
      "instituted only on 23.03.1998, which is clearly barred by limitation.\n",
      "12. It was submitted that the Trial Court had found that the endorsements \n",
      "were silent regarding extension of time, which finding has not been \n",
      "disturbed either by the First Appellate Court or the High Court and [2024] 1 S.C.R.  379\n",
      "Alagammal and Ors. v. Ganesan and Anr.\n",
      "looking at the issue from such angle, six months’ time under the \n",
      "Agreement would expire on 21.05.1991 and a three-year limitation \n",
      "would end on 22.05.1994. On this, learned counsel submitted that \n",
      "the contention of the respondents that the limitation would start \n",
      "from the judgment rendered in Original Suit No.551 of 1992 dated \n",
      "24.07.1996, filed by appellant no.1 for seeking possession and eviction \n",
      "of her husband and mother-in-law from the suit property, is not the \n",
      "correct legal perspective, as mere absence of possession would not \n",
      "have defeated the passing of title from the appellants in favour of \n",
      "the respondents by the execution of a Sale Deed. The object of the \n",
      "Agreement was only for conveying the title of the property in question.\n",
      "13. Learned counsel submitted that neither Original Suit No.551 of 1992 \n",
      "nor the judgment rendered therein have been mentioned by the \n",
      "respondents in Original Suit No.165 of 1998 for computing the cause \n",
      "of action for filing suit in the year 1998 with regard to the Agreement, \n",
      "which was entered into in 1990. Further, it was urged that it was \n",
      "incumbent upon the respondents to have obtained the Sale Deed \n",
      "and possession through Court as set forth in the Default Clause in \n",
      "the Agreement and thus, the Legal Notice dated 18.11.1997 by the \n",
      "respondents would not extend the time as it had expired much before \n",
      "and such unilateral issuance of notice would not get over the legal \n",
      "bar of Article 54 of the Limitation Act, 1963 (hereinafter referred to \n",
      "as the “Act”).\n",
      "14. Learned counsel summed up arguments by contending that in any \n",
      "view of the matter, prior to filing of the suit, the property in question had \n",
      "already been sold under registered Sale Deed to the appellant no.7 \n",
      "and the suit for specific performance was required to be dismissed \n",
      "as the Sale Deed to appellant no.7 has not been challenged.\n",
      "15. Learned counsel relied upon the decision of this Court in K.S. \n",
      "Vidyanadam v Vairavan, (1997) 3 SCC 1, at Paragraphs 10, 11 \n",
      "and 13 for the proposition that Courts in India have consistently held \n",
      "that in the case of agreement of sale relating to immovable property, \n",
      "time is not the essence of the contract unless specifically provided \n",
      "to that effect, and the period of limitation prescribed by the Act for \n",
      "filing a suit was 3 years.\n",
      "16. It was contended that in the aforesaid judgment, the terms of the \n",
      "agreement therein were identical to the instant Agreement, inasmuch \n",
      "as there was no reference to any tenant in the building and it was 380 [2024] 1 S.C.R.\n",
      "Digital Supreme Court Reports\n",
      "stated that within six months, the plaintiff should purchase the \n",
      "stamp-papers and pay the balance consideration upon which the \n",
      "defendants shall execute the Sale Deed either in his name or the \n",
      "name(s) proposed by him before the Sub-Registrar. It was restated \n",
      "that there was no prior letter/notice from the plaintiffs (respondents) \n",
      "to the defendants (appellants) calling upon them to get the Sale Deed \n",
      "executed till the issuance of the Legal Notice dated 18.11.1997 i.e., \n",
      "after a gap of 6 ½ years, identical to the facts in K.S. Vidyanadam \n",
      "(supra).\n",
      "SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS:\n",
      "17. In opposition to the appeal, learned counsel for the respondents \n",
      "submitted that on 23.03.1992, appellant no.1 had filed Original Suit \n",
      "No.551 of 1992 against her husband, mother-in-law, second wife of \n",
      "her husband and the son of the second wife, which was decreed. \n",
      "He submitted that appellants even after accepting Rs.425/- over \n",
      "and above the amount indicated in the Agreement and even after \n",
      "getting a decree for declaration and possession of the suit property \n",
      "in her favour on 24.07.1996, did not execute the Sale Deed due \n",
      "to which Legal Notice was sent to her on 18.11.1997. As no action \n",
      "was taken, the respondents were forced to file a suit on 23.03.1998 \n",
      "seeking specific performance.\n",
      "18. Learned counsel submitted that the First Appellate Court had recorded \n",
      "that the Sale Deed executed by appellant no.1 in favour of appellant \n",
      "no.7 dated 05.11.1997 was not bonafide as the said sale was effected \n",
      "after getting an order for declaration and recovery of possession of \n",
      "the suit property in favour of appellant no.1 on 24.07.1996 in Original \n",
      "Suit No.551 of 1992.\n",
      "19. Learned counsel submitted that the issue whether time is the \n",
      "essence of the contract i.e., the Agreement would depend also on \n",
      "the conduct of the parties and in the present case, when money \n",
      "was accepted by appellant no.1, much after the stipulated time, \n",
      "clearly the Agreement’s validity so as to culminate in sale could not \n",
      "be said to have been extinguished, as by accepting money later, \n",
      "the time indicated for completion of the transaction by execution of \n",
      "Sale Deed had been relaxed.\n",
      "20. It was contended that the actual intention of the parties was not \n",
      "only to execute the Sale Deed but also handover the possession [2024] 1 S.C.R.  381\n",
      "Alagammal and Ors. v. Ganesan and Anr.\n",
      "which is an implied term of every sale of immovable property and \n",
      "thus only when on 24.07.1996, the appellant concerned became \n",
      "capable of handing over possession, limitation would start from such \n",
      "date as otherwise even if the Sale Deed was executed in favour of \n",
      "the respondents, it would have been of no real consequence in the \n",
      "absence of possession being capable of hand over.\n",
      "21. Learned counsel contended that the stand taken by the appellants, \n",
      "that the proposed sale was only for transfer of title and not possession, \n",
      "cannot be accepted since the sale of immovable property is always \n",
      "for the transfer of possession from the seller to the buyer in terms of \n",
      "Section 5 read with Section 54 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 \n",
      "(hereinafter referred to as the “TP Act”). Further, it was submitted that \n",
      "Section 55(f) of the TP Act contemplates duty of the seller to hand \n",
      "over possession of the property at the time of sale, and if the seller \n",
      "is not in possession of the property at the time of the agreement to \n",
      "sell or thereafter, it is a “material defect” in the property necessarily \n",
      "to be disclosed to the purchaser at the time of sale in accordance \n",
      "with Section 55(1)(a) of the TP Act. Thus, according to him, it is the \n",
      "obligation of the seller to hand over possession at the time of sale, \n",
      "as was stipulated in the Agreement.\n",
      "22. On the question of whether time is of the essence in such a contract, \n",
      "it was contended that when a party is not in possession to hand over \n",
      "the same at the time of execution of an agreement for sale, then \n",
      "time would not be of the essence as the right to sue would accrue in \n",
      "favour of the person to whom the suit property is required to be sold \n",
      "only upon the vendor being in a position to hand over possession of \n",
      "the property to the buyer. It was further submitted that subsequent \n",
      "conduct of parties is also relevant for testing whether time is of the \n",
      "essence of the contract in question. It was submitted that in the \n",
      "present case, the acceptance of money much after the expiry of the \n",
      "six-month period by the appellant no.1 from the respondents leaves \n",
      "no doubt that time was not the essence and the time for performance \n",
      "of the Agreement would commence only after obtainment of physical \n",
      "possession by the appellants.\n",
      "23. In support of his contentions, learned counsel relied upon the decision \n",
      "of this Court in Godhra Electricity Company Limited v State of 382 [2024] 1 S.C.R.\n",
      "Digital Supreme Court Reports\n",
      "Gujarat, (1975) 1 SCC 199, the relevant paragraphs being 11 to 16; \n",

      "ANALYSIS, REASONING AND CONCLUSION:\n",
      "24. Having considered the matter, this Court finds that the Judgment \n",

      "property in question, out of which Rs.3,000/- was already paid as \n",

      "with appellant no.1, the Sale Deed could not have been executed.\n",
      "27. Another important aspect that the Court is expected to consider is \n",
      "the fact that the appellant no.7 in whose favour there was a Sale \n",
      "Deed with regard to the suit premises, much prior to issuance of \n",
      "any Legal Notice and the institution of the suit in question and that \n",
      "no relief had been sought for cancellation of such Sale Deed, a suit \n",
      "for specific performance for execution of sale deed qua the very \n",
      "same property could not be maintained. The matter becomes worse \n",
      "for the respondents since such relief was also not sought even at \n",
      "the First Appeal stage nor at the Second Appeal stage, despite the \n",
      "law permitting and providing for such course of action. Even the \n",
      "Legal Notice dated 18.11.1997 has been issued after almost seven \n",
